         <p><b>A Compelling Opportunity for 2017</b></p>
         <p><b>With an annual return of 17.5%<sup>1</sup> for 2016, the US High Yield market delivered its strongest performance since 2009 in a rally fueled by the outperformance of the commodity sectors and CCC-rated bonds. However, against the current backdrop of a low rate environment, we continue to believe the US high yield market represents a sensible, low duration fixed income investment option in an environment in which stable, unleveraged income is difficult to obtain.</b></p>
         <br>
         <p>The High Yield market has matured over the last decade as it has grown from $950 billion in 2008 to about $1.6 trillion today <sup>2</sup>. Over that time, the quality of the market has improved. Since 2013, 55% of new issuance has been BB-rated, compared to a 20-year average of 42%. The largest high yield issuers are generally publicly traded companies raising capital for corporate M&amp;A or refinancing. This is in contrast to a decade ago, when roughly one-quarter of new issuance was LBO financing. In addition, capital structures have become simpler and high yield has transitioned to a more stable, unleveraged investor base with a longer term view.</p>
         <p><b>6.5% Coupon Is Attractive In A Near Zero World</b></p>
         <p>US high yield remains an attractive investment opportunity in the current environment of low interest rates. The market average coupon today is about six-and-a-half percent and high yield has a shorter duration relative to other fixed income asset classes. The US high yield market has historically performed well during periods of rising rates because they often signal improving economic conditions and inflation.</p>
         <p><b>Defaults are expected to remain modest</b></p>
         <p>The US economy is fairly stable and growing which is a good backdrop for high yield bonds. For the broader market, we expect defaults to remain modest as the quality of issuance has improved and signs of aggressive issuance are not evident in high yield.</p>
         <p><b>Margin of Safety</b></p>
         <p>The High Yield Group utilizes a bottom-up investment process with a value orientation and long term outlook. Due to their asymmetric reward and risk profiles, investing in high yield bonds requires special attention to downside protection. We look for that additional cushion, or “margin-of-safety” through asset coverage. For us to consider investing in a high yield security, we require the asset coverage to be at least 1.5x. This investment process imposes a discipline that keeps us focused on credits with significant downside cushion, so that an unforeseen development doesn’t immediately put a recovery value at risk. Through our focus on rigorous credit analysis, we have been able to outperform the high yield market over the long term, through superior credit selection, while mitigating downside risks.</p>

      <p> <b> Municipals: Location, Location, Location </b></p>
      <p> It turns out that location applies to more than just real estate. Location matters for municipal bond portfolios, too, according to David Dowden, Portfolio Manager at MacKay Municipal Managers <sup>TM </sup>. </p>
      <p> <b> Location: By State</b></p>
      <p>As a new administration moves forward on an economic agenda that includes federal tax cuts, Dowden and his colleagues believe bonds issued in states with relatively high income tax rates will outperform those of states with low or no taxes, especially when it comes to responsible issuers. One of the advantages of municipal bonds is that, in many states, they are exempt from state income taxes in the state they are issued. As federal tax rates are lowered, a greater awareness of the tax bite attributable to state taxes should ensue. California (13.3%) and New York (8.82%) rank among those states with relatively high income tax rates. </p>
      <p> <b> Location: Along the Yield Curve </b></p>
      <p>The team believes the most attractive maturities along the municipal bond yield curve are currently below four years and beyond 10 years (see chart below). One metric municipal bond investors routinely monitor is the ratio of municipal bond yields to those of same-maturity Treasury bonds. (As shown, municipal bond yields were recently at or near parity with Treasury bond yields – despite municipal bonds being exempt from federal income taxes – along most parts of the yield curve.) The exception shown occurs in the five-year maturity range, where municipal bond yields were approximately 87% that of Treasury yields. Given the shape of the yield curve, the common practice of laddering individual bonds with staggered maturities could leave many investors overly exposed to those maturities along the yield curve that are relatively expensive at this time, when compared to longer-term bonds and the interest-rate risk of intermediate bonds. </p>

      <p><i>Source: Bloomberg, as of 2/17/17. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, which will vary. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Yield is the coupon amount of a bond divided by its price. It shows the return an investor receives on a bond. The municipal/Treasury ratio compares the yield of municipal bonds to U.S. Treasurys. Bond valuation is the act of evaluating certain aspects of a bond, like interest rate, yield, and maturity date, to determine the fair value of the bond. The Treasury yield is based on the Treasury yield curve. The municipal bond yield is calculated by the Municipal Market Monitor for various maturities along the calculated curve. The curve is a baseline curve for tax-exempt municipal bonds. It is populated with high-quality municipal bonds, with an average rating of AAA from Moody’s and S&amp;P.</i></p>
      <p> <b> Location: Along the Credit Spectrum </b></p>
      <p> Dowden was quick to acknowledge that high-yield municipal bond spreads have contracted early this year (see chart). But, they’ve only partially reversed the spread widening that took place last year, leaving potentially more room for spreads to narrow further, as the economy grows, ratings are upgraded, and the Fed raises rates in 2017. Historically, lower-rated, revenue-backed bonds have outperformed general obligation and higher-quality bonds in rising-rate environments. The team recommends being overweight high-yield municipal bonds in their asset allocation framework. </p>

      <p><i> Source: Thomson Reuters DataStream, as of 2/21/17. Credit Ratings: S&amp;P rates borrowers on a scale from AAA to D. AAA through BBB represent investment grade, while BB through D represent non-investment grade. Moody’s rates borrowers on a scale from Aaa through C. Aaa through Baa3 represent investment grade, while Ba1 through C represent non-investment grade. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. </i></p>
      <p> <b> Duration Band </b></p>
      <p> Although the team makes many active choices, the duration of their strategies stays the course. The team maintains a duration posture of staying within a band around its benchmark. Highly liquid hedges are used, as needed, to stay within the targeted duration band.</p>
      <p> <b> Thoughts on Liquidity and Fluctuating Prices</b></p>
      <p> An easing of the regulatory and oversight burden currently imposed on the finance industry leaves Dowden and the team expecting liquidity in the marketplace to improve in 2017, but to do so unevenly. Preferences by banking institutions should favor issues rated by at least one agency, while unrated issues face liquidity challenges. In addition, the uncertainties caused by new legislation at the federal level could cause periodic price fluctuations across different sectors. </p>
      <p> We believe that experienced investment teams with a disciplined understanding of their market are in a favorable position to identify value in volatile markets, manage risk, and generate attractive returns.</p>
      <p> <b> Parting Thoughts </b></p>
      <p> For investors seeking after-tax income, the municipal bond market continues to offer a robust opportunity set. Like the case of real estate, location matters.</p>

      <p> <b>Convertibles: Sharp Handling of the Trump, Dow 20,000 Turns</b></p>
      <p>We recently caught up with portfolio manager Edward Silverstein, of the MacKay Shields' Convertible Bond Team.</p>
      <p> <b>Election to December 31</b></p>
      <p>Following the November 8 election and a few hours of market upheaval, the stock market soared higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing the year just shy of 20,000 – a level it would later reach on January 25, 2017.</p>
      <p>If we look at asset class level performance between the election and year-end 2016, the BofA Merrill Lynch All U.S. Convertibles Bond Index returned 3.99%, or about four-fifths of the 4.98% return of the S&amp;P 500 Index. By contrast, a popular bond benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, returned -2.10%, as investors focused on the possibility of tax cuts, fiscal stimulus, and reduced regulations.</p>

      <p><small><i>Source: Asset class level performance between 11/8/16 and 12/31/16. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, which will vary. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.</i></small></p>
      <p> The latest run-up serves as a reminder that convertibles can behave quite differently at times from other bonds. Over the past 15 years ended December 31, convertibles had a negative .29 correlation to long-term Treasurys and a negative .26 correlation to intermediate-term Treasurys.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <p> <b>Pledges, Promises, and 60/40</b></p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Silverstein believes the new administration has to transform pledges, promises, and executive orders into some more tangible accomplishments in the next 9-12 months to keep the market’s animal spirits, well, up. Meanwhile, corporate profits are growing, and the typical convertible bond today (the average bond that makes up the index) has a price of about 116 and a “delta” near .60, meaning convertibles might realistically be expected to capture about 60% of any orderly upward stock market move or, alternatively, 40% of any orderly downward stock market move.<sup>2</sup></p>
      <p> <b>Relative Value and Economic Outlook</b></p>
      <p>Silverstein and the team believe equities and equity-linked securities are attractively valued, compared to the low yields on offer on U.S. Treasury bonds and investment-grade debt. They feel the U.S. stock market is fully valued, but should benefit, as profits grow.</p>
      <p>Modest economic growth is expected to continue in the U.S. and globally, alongside low, but rising, inflation and interest rates. The Fed is expected to gradually raise rates, but monetary policies around the world should remain accommodative. Given these conditions, we believe equities and equity-linked securities have the potential to perform reasonably well in the 12-18 months ahead. However, it is not an environment that encourages taking unnecessary risks. In this sense, convertible securities can help investors participate in equity market advances, while providing the potential for some downside protection, should volatility occur.</p>
      <p>Silverstein is generally encouraged by the fourth-quarter 2016 earnings calls he has listened to so far this reporting season. The team is overweight energy and industrials versus its benchmark and peers. By contrast, the team is underweight financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs).</p>
      <p> <b>Odds ‘n’ Ends</b></p>
      <p>Convertible issuance has been robust in 2017, so far. Issuance in January totaled $3.3 billion<sup>3</sup>.  Companies want to obtain low-cost financing, given that interest rates may be higher down the road than they are today.</p>
      <p> <b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>Continued economic growth, low but rising inflation, and attractive valuations provide an encouraging backdrop to an asset class that has little correlation to changing interest rates and less historical volatility than the equity market.</p>

      <p><b>An Opportunity</b></p>
      The election of Donald J. Trump is expected to be one of the more disruptive geopolitical and economic events of the last half century which we anticipate will create both investment opportunities and dislocations. The new administration seeks to usher in significant policy changes impacting trade, taxation, health care, energy and more – with many potential winners and losers. Cabinet nominations to date suggest that there will be little retreat from most major campaign promises. This could lead to substantial regulatory, political and legislative changes. We expect this will have a profound impact on various sectors of the US equity and debt markets as well as many foreign markets, with implications for much of the US economy and a number of non-US economies. With control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, the new administration should be well positioned to implement many policy initiatives. The Democratic Party is at its weakest position politically in years within Congress but also within a majority of state legislatures across the country, and is additionally vulnerable to more losses within the Senate in the 2018 mid-term elections given the high number of democratic senators up for re-election in states won by President Elect Trump. All of these forces suggest a period in which the new administration will have the power to enact many of its most important priorities. Against this backdrop, as investment opportunities present themselves, we believe actively managed portfolios with greater investment flexibility should produce returns superior to those of a more complacent approach such as indexing.
      <p></p>
      <p>Dan Roberts, Chief Investment Officer of MKS-Global Fixed Income previously held posts in the Reagan Administration on both the Presidents Council of Economic Advisors and the US Congress Joint Economic Committee where he gained significant  knowledge of the power of politics and economics.  Against this backdrop, as the landscape changes, we believe actively managed portfolio's with greater investment flexibility and a comprehensive understanding of top-down and political factors are well suited to enhance returns through asset allocation versus a more complacent approach such as indexing.</p>
      <p><b>The MacKay Shields Edge</b></p>
      Dan Roberts’ background and the GFI team resources are well suited to understand the economic and capital market implications of the new policies likely to be introduced by the new administration. In addition to more than 25 years of investment experience, Dan previously served in the Reagan administration as a member of staff to the President’s Council of Economic Advisors from 1981 to 1983 and then as the Executive Director [Chief of Staff] of the US Congress’ Joint Economic Committee from 1984 to 1985. He also served as an economist at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from 1977 to 1978. He also previously worked at Chase Manhattan Bank, initially as a Financial Economist before being named head of Global Interest Rate and Currency Swaps Trading.
